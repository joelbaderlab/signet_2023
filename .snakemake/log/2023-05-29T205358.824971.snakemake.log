MissingOutputException in line 22 of /Users/joel/Dropbox/GITHUB_JOELBADERLAB/signet_2023/Snakefile.py:
Job Missing files after 0 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
dummy.txt completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 1
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
